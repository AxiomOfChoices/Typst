  abstract = {It is still an open question whether a compact embedded hypersurface in the Euclidean space Rn+1 with constant mean curvature and spherical boundary is necessarily a hyperplanar ball or a spherical cap, even in the simplest case of surfaces in R3. In a recent paper, Al{\textasciiacute}{\i}as and Malacarne (Rev. Mat. Iberoamericana 18 (2002), 431--442) have shown that this is true for the case of hypersurfaces in Rn+1 with constant scalar curvature, and more generally, hypersurfaces with constant higher-order rmean curvature, when r 2. In this paper we deal with some aspects of the classical problem above, by considering it in a more general context. Specifically, our starting general ambient space is an orientable Riemannian manifold M{\textasciimacron} , where we will consider a general geometric configuration consisting of an immersed hypersurface into M{\textasciimacron} with boundary on an oriented hypersurface P of M{\textasciimacron} . For such a geometric configuration, we study the relationship between the geometry of the hypersurface along its boundary and the geometry of its boundary as a hypersurface of P , as well as the geometry of P as a hypersurface of M{\textasciimacron} . Our approach allows us to derive, among others, interesting results for the case where the ambient space has constant curvature (the Euclidean space Rn+1, the hyperbolic space Hn+1, and the sphere Sn+1). In particular, we are able to extend the symmetry results given in the recent paper mentioned above to the case of hypersurfaces with constant higher-order r-mean curvature in the hyperbolic space and in the sphere.},

In this article, we study the conformal vector fields on a Riemannian manifold and present the existing results as well as some new results on the characterization of these spaces.

  abstract = {This paper continues the investigation of isoperimetric inequalities through volume preserving and area decreasing mean curvature type flows related to conformal Killing vector fields. Results of this kind prior to this paper all studied convex hypersurfaces or hypersurfaces which are starshaped with respect to generalized dilations. This paper is the first to study results of this kind for hypersurfaces which are starshaped with respect to general conformal Killing vector fields perturbed by an isometric Killing vector field and our flows allow us to establish isoperimetric inequalities for a much wider class of hypersurfaces. For example, our results apply to hypersurfaces in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{n+1\}\$ which are far from being starshaped in the traditional sense, but are starshaped with respect to the conformal Killing vector field composed of a dilation and a rotational vector field. The flow considered in this paper is a novel modification of the mean curvature-type flow first introduced by Guan and Li, which was later generalized by Guan-Li-Wang and Li-Pan.},
