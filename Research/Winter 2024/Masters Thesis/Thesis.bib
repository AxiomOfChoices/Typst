  abstract = {In this article, we introduce a new type of mean curvature flow for bounded star-shaped domains in space forms and prove its longtime existence, exponential convergence without any curvature assumption. Along this flow, the enclosed volume is a constant and the surface area evolves monotonically. Moreover, for a bounded convex domain in R n+1, the quermassintegrals evolve monotonically along the flow which allows us to prove a class of Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities of quermassintegrals.},

  abstract = {In this article, we continue the work in [7] and study a normalized hypersurface flow in the more general ambient setting of warped product spaces. This flow preserves the volume of the bounded domain enclosed by a graphical hypersurface, and monotonically decreases the hypersurface area. As an application, the isoperimetric problem in warped product spaces is solved for such domains.},
