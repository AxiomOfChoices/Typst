In this article, we study the conformal vector fields on a Riemannian manifold and present the existing results as well as some new results on the characterization of these spaces. Taking clue from the analytic vector fields on a complex manifold, we define {$\varphi$}-analytic conformal vector fields on a Riemannian manifold and study their properties as well as obtain characterizations of the Euclidean space (Rn,{$\langle$},{$\rangle$}) and the n-sphere Sn(c) of constant curvature c using these vector fields.},

  abstract = {This paper continues the investigation of isoperimetric inequalities through volume preserving and area decreasing mean curvature type flows related to conformal Killing vector fields. Results of this kind prior to this paper all studied convex hypersurfaces or hypersurfaces which are starshaped with respect to generalized dilations. This paper is the first to study results of this kind for hypersurfaces which are starshaped with respect to general conformal Killing vector fields perturbed by an isometric Killing vector field and our flows allow us to establish isoperimetric inequalities for a much wider class of hypersurfaces. For example, our results apply to hypersurfaces in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\^\{n+1\}\$ which are far from being starshaped in the traditional sense, but are starshaped with respect to the conformal Killing vector field composed of a dilation and a rotational vector field. The flow considered in this paper is a novel modification of the mean curvature-type flow first introduced by Guan and Li, which was later generalized by Guan-Li-Wang and Li-Pan.},

Moreover, for a bounded convex domain in R n+1, the quermassintegrals evolve monotonically along the flow which allows us to prove a class of Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities of quermassintegrals.},

The solutions are then considered, ordered by their symmetry group, their algebraic structure (Petrov type) or other invariant properties such as special subspaces or tensor fields and embedding properties. Includes all the developments in the field since the first edition and contains six completely new chapters, covering topics including generation methods and their application, colliding waves, classification of metrics by invariants and treatments of homothetic motions.
