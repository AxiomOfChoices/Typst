    In this article, we introduce a new type of mean curvature flow for bounded
    star-shaped domains in space forms and prove its longtime existence,
    exponential convergence without any curvature assumption. Along this flow,
    the enclosed volume is a constant and the surface area evolves
    monotonically. Moreover, for a bounded convex domain in R n+1, the
    quermassintegrals evolve monotonically along the flow which allows us to
    prove a class of Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities of quermassintegrals.

    In this article, we continue the work in [7] and study a normalized
    hypersurface ﬂow in the more general ambient setting of warped product
    spaces. This ﬂow preserves the volume of the bounded domain enclosed by a
    graphical hypersurface, and monotonically decreases the hypersurface area.
    As an application, the isoperimetric problem in warped product spaces is
    solved for such domains.
